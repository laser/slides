# Normative Statements


---

## Treat vibe coding as a movement you build support for

- Steve frames vibe coding as a social/organizational push, not just a tool choice
- Quote: "It's absolutely a movement... You gotta get people behind it."


---

## Abandon old software-production habits and embrace agentic workflows

- He casts the shift as leaving prior methods behind in favor of "new ways"
- Quote: "vibe coding is about abandoning the old ways... and embracing the new ways"


---

## Stop relying on IDE-first development and learn agentic coding now

- He makes an explicit value judgment about IDE-centric work
- Quote: "If you're still using an IDE... by January 1st, you're a bad engineer."
- Quote: "this is the time that you need to drop it and learn how agents code."


---

## Invest serious practice time to become competent with agents

- He rejects "tried it for two hours" as meaningful evaluation
- Quote: "you have to spend 200 hours... You have to spend 2000 hours with it."
- Quote: "before you... can predict what it's going to do."


---

## Do not anthropomorphize LLMs

- He warns that "human-like" behavior leads to unsafe over-trust
- Quote: "Never make the mistake of anthropomorphizing an LLM."
- Quote: "The LLM at any moment can stab you in the back."


---

## Keep production out of agent loops (at least initially)

- He treats production access as an explicit red line
- Quote: "Keep prod out."
- Quote: "It's gonna be real tempting... but don't."


---

## Learn from multiple angles (books, talks, analogies) to internalize the shift

- He recommends broad learning inputs because different framings "land differently"
- Quote: "you should get all of the possible angles at it."
- Quote: "Read the O'Reilly, watch the talk."


---

## Prefer agent-driven iteration over manual micro-edits; treat the IDE as a tool for the AI

- He argues manual edits are often counterproductive in agent workflows
- Quote: "it's better for you to close your IDE..."
- Quote: "you shouldn't look in it... It's a tool for the AI now."


---

## Judge AI-coded software by outcomes, not authorship

- He argues the relevant metric is whether the system works for users
- Quote: "it's all about the outcome."
- Quote: "Beads is working... [with] tens of thousands of... happy people."


---

## Teach kids "vibe coding" as the new default

- He gives a prescriptive answer to whether kids should learn to code
- Quote: "kids should learn to vibe code."


---

# Predictions


---

## Backlash against agentic coding will intensify

- He predicts resistance will grow as capabilities and adoption increase
- Quote: "there's a huge backlash... only just brewing now."
- Quote: "we will see a massive backlash from the Luddites."


---

## Agent adoption will create ~10x performance gaps inside companies

- He predicts large measurable differences between adopters and non-adopters
- Quote: "the performance difference is like 10 x..."
- Quote: "one of them is 10 times as productive than the other one."


---

## Companies will "panic" and escalate to HR/legal over these gaps

- He predicts organizational/administrative escalation as a direct consequence
- Quote: "And the answer is you panic."
- Quote: "you actually go to HR and you go to legal..."


---

## Today's elite engineers who don't adopt will be sidelined quickly

- He predicts status inversion for highly skilled but non-adopting engineers
- Quote: "Those people are gonna be the interns in a year."


---

## Agent tools will materially improve next year

- He predicts near-term product evolution that reduces today's pain points
- Quote: "next year the tools will be better."


---

## The post-IDE interface will be an agent orchestration dashboard

- He predicts the primary "dev environment" becomes a visual agent-control surface
- Quote: "it's gonna be your agent orchestration dashboard."
- Quote: "You just go through the list..."


---

## Orchestrators will become a standard layer above agents

- He predicts orchestration will offload routine decisions to cheaper models
- Quote: "I called the orchestrators are coming..."
- Quote: "often a cheaper model... Just have haiku say either one"


---

## "Multi-agent" will become the dominant theme next year

- He predicts industry attention and systems design will center on multi-agent setups
- Quote: "AI will be about multi-agent."
- Quote: "we're moving next year..."


---

## Large-scale agent coding will hit a major merge/serialization wall

- He predicts merging becomes the key constraint once many developers go 10x
- Quote: "Merging is the... wall that everyone is hitting right now."
- Quote: "Nobody has solved this..."


---

## Open-source models will close the frontier gap on a short timeline

- He predicts OSS models approach frontier capability and drive tooling changes
- Quote: "Next year could be the year of open source models."
- Quote: "OSS models will be as good as Gemini three next summer."
